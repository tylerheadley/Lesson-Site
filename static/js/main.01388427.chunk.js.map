Water Discovery will teach various safety and foundational skills; games, toys, and songs will be included. For private Water Discovery lessons, a parent is welcome to join, though this is optional. For group Water Discovery lessons, it is mandatory that a/both parent(s) accompany their swimmer in-water throughout the lesson. Water Discovery group classes can be likened to traditional “mommy & me” classes.

This level ensures that children are safe, fully acclimated to the water, and have shown mastery of the roll-over technique and the back float. Without these skills, students will not be able to progress further in this curriculum. Games, toys, and equipment are included. All instruction will take place in the main pool, independent of their parents. We will provide elevated platforms to ensure children can stand with their heads above water. \n                </p>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"container\">\n                <h4>Goldfish</h4>\n                <p>\n                    Goldfish is for swimmers who can back float on their own for at least 10 seconds, roll onto their backs from their stomachs (and visa versa) on their own, and are confident in the water and ready to learn the basics of Freestyle. If they cannot demonstrate these skills unassisted, we recommend placement into the Guppy level. Goldfish will learn strokes, kicking, treading, and our roll-over-to-breath technique. Kickboards, pull buoys, rings, and toys will be provided. All instruction will take place in the main pool (occasionally the deep end, if swimmers are comfortable), and all Goldfish are in training for the Deep Water test. \n                </p>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"container\">\n                <h4>Pike</h4>\n                <p>\n                    Pike is for swimmers who have mastered the basics of freestyle–often, Pikes already have their deep-water badge. This level is designed to refine swimmers’ Freestyle by teaching technical side-breathing, introduce backstroke and diving as well. Kickboards, pull buoys, and rings will be provided for technical instruction. All instruction will take place in the 5-foot section of the main pool, lap lanes, and the deep end. \n                </p>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"container\">\n                <h4>Stingray</h4>\n                <p>\n                    This level is for non-competitive swimmers who seek to refine their Freestyle and Backstroke technique and for those who seek to learn or refine their Breaststroke, Butterfly, Flip-Turns, and/or Diving off of the block. Our Stingray instructors are qualified to teach advanced instruction. Instruction at the Stingray level is not equivalent to Sport-Specific training. Kick-boards, pull buoys, and rings will be provided for technical instruction. All instruction will take place in the lap lanes of the main pool and the deep end. \n                </p>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"container\">\n                <h4>Sport Specific</h4>\n                <p>\n                    Our Sport-Specific lessons are designed to offer one-on-one technical to S.O.
